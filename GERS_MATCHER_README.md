# Overture GERS ID Matcher

## 🎯 Overview

The **Overture GERS ID Matcher** is an ArcGIS Pro add-in feature that enables users to:

1. **Load Overture Maps Data** - Import transportation data from Overture Maps Parquet files
2. **Match User Data to GERS IDs** - Conflate existing transportation data with Overture's Global Entity Reference System
3. **Leverage Native ArcGIS Tools** - Use built-in ArcGIS Pro splitting and LRS tools for segment processing

This provides a bridge between local/regional transportation datasets and the emerging global standard for transportation network referencing.

## 🌟 Why This Approach is Better

### **Strategic Focus**
- **Data Loading**: Best-in-class Overture Maps Parquet import
- **GERS Matching**: Unique conflation capabilities not available elsewhere  
- **Native Integration**: Use ArcGIS Pro's proven splitting and LRS tools instead of reinventing them

### **Workflow Integration**
1. **Load Overture Data** → This add-in imports Parquet files seamlessly
2. **Load User Data** → Standard ArcGIS Pro data sources (Shapefiles, Geodatabases, etc.)
3. **Split if Needed** → Use native ArcGIS Pro tools (Split, Create Routes, etc.)
4. **Match to GERS** → This add-in provides sophisticated conflation
5. **Enhanced LRS** → Use standard ArcGIS Pro Linear Referencing tools with GERS IDs

### **Technical Advantages**
- **Proven Splitting**: ArcGIS Pro's splitting tools are mature and well-tested
- **Focus on Value**: This add-in focuses on unique capabilities (Overture import + GERS matching)
- **Better Performance**: Native tools are optimized for large datasets
- **Familiar Interface**: Users already know ArcGIS Pro splitting workflows

## 🏗️ Architecture

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Current Branch Setup**
```bash
# Switch to the clean GERS matcher branch
git checkout feature/overture-gers-matcher

# This branch now contains:
# - OvertureGERSMatcher.cs (GERS matching service)
# - DataProcessor.cs (Overture data loading)
# - MfcUtility.cs (utility functions)
# - Clean UI focused on loading + matching
```

### **Recommended User Workflow**
1. **Import Overture Data** → Use this add-in
2. **Load Your Data** → Standard ArcGIS Pro import
3. **Split Segments** → Use ArcGIS Pro splitting tools as needed
4. **Match to GERS** → Use this add-in's conflation features
5. **Build LRS** → Use ArcGIS Pro Linear Referencing tools

## 📋 Current Status

### **✅ Completed**
- Removed transportation splitting code
